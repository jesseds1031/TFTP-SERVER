Throughout my capstone work, I completed a variety of different research, interviewing, planning, and coding activities that helped culminate my group’s project, PassWorld. The idea behind PassWorld was to create a more comprehensive password manager that educated users on cybersecurity as they used it. The motivation behind this project was to create a product that helps younger people (primarily teenagers) who are just starting to learn how to navigate and control their identity online. Another factor that motivated me was that I wanted to be a part of cybersecurity research and challenge myself to explore new frameworks, coding techniques, and create a real solution to the problems I identified in my research. This step was the first part of my capstone work, in which I investigated a few main research questions. These were, “What is currently preventing teenagers from using password managers?”, and “What is currently missing in these teen’s education regarding cybersecurity?” To answer these questions, I compiled research and started to define what educational content was needed and what UI/UX design principles would best apply to teenagers. I also created a survey that aimed to collect data on our stakeholders’ current password management and practices online. After this initial research, I started to develop some outlines for the educational content modules. I identified key areas of common misunderstandings teens had about staying safe online, and focused primarily on how to manage and develop strong passwords. From here, I started on some of the first coding work, which consisted of basic program outlines and encryption/decryption code for password storage. However, after meeting with Professor Bobby Kuzma, one of my group’s industry experts, he revealed the there was an open-source password manager we could build off of called KeePassXC. After considering his feedback and doing a bit more research into what developing a full-fledged password manager entails, we decided to build off the pre-existing source code so we could focus on what was truly novel about this project.
